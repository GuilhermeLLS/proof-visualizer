# Proof Visualizer

To run this application, you need [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on your computer.

Run this command in the root folder to run the application:

`make run`

You will need to run it as a root user. You can do extra [configurations](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) to avoid this.
