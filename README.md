# CVC5 Proof Visualizer

This project is a visualizer for proof certificate generated by [CVC5](https://github.com/cvc5/cvc5), a SMT solver. This website provides customizable views through graphs and tables that allow a better understanding of certificates and the operation of SMT solvers.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.


## WebAssembly

The proof visualizer allows to run the CVC5 solver inside the browser. The WebAssembly binary used to run this in the browser is compiled via [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/).

The [CVC5-WASM](https://github.com/ufmg-smite/cvc5-wasm) repository was built to give an easy way to compile the library to WebAssembly. This repository is able to generate the .wasm file needed to run the library inside the web app.

As the expectations to support this app are not that long, the user is able to use the CVC5-WASM repository, generate a .wasm file and substitute the current .wasm file located at `/frontend/public/cvc5.wasm` , then using a more recent version of CVC5. The version of the emscripten used to compile the current binary is the 3.1.18.
